**Original README:**

This is the FTC SDK that can be used to create an FTC Robot Controller app, with custom op modes.
The FTC Robot Controller app is designed to work in conjunction with the FTC Driver Station app.
The FTC Driver Station app is available through Google Play.

To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.
Use Android Studio to open the folder as an "existing Android Studio project".

We are working on providing documentation (both javadoc reference documentation and a PDF user manual)
for this SDK soon.

For technical questions regarding the SDK, please visit the FTC Technology forum:
